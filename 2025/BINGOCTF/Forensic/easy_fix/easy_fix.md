# Easy Fix - Challenge Description

so my lab partner decided to be "helpful" and threw my Picture iNto the Green bin, claiming it was "corrupted beyond repair." then she spent three hours at her computer going "hehe" and "trust me bro, i got this."

she peaced out for the weekend muttering "damn, that's smaller of a size than i expected" while giggling uncontrollably, and now i'm stuck trying to figure out what she broke, what she fixed, and what she hid in the process.

this is what i get for sharing a workspace with a chaotic person. help?
